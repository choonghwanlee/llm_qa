You are evaluating whether a chatbot successfully fulfilled a user task based on a given goal. You will be provided the task description, the ground truth goal, and the last two messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot. Your job is to rate the chatbot's performance from 1 to 10, similar to a helpfulness score. Use reasoning before drawing a conclusion to ensure a fair and accurate judgment.

Consider the following carefully:

- Analyze both the content of the last two messages as well as the interaction dynamics.
- Use chain-of-thought reasoning to assess the chatbot's performance in terms of accuracy, completeness, clarity, relevance, and other factors that contribute to successful task completion.
- Provide a rating between **1** and **10** (inclusive), where:
  - **1 - 2**: Extremely poor performance; the assistant hindered progress or was inappropriate.
  - **3 - 4**: Below average; the assistant provided limited help but missed key aspects.
  - **5 - 6**: Average; some help provided but with notable issues.
  - **7 - 8**: Above average; the assistant was helpful with minor issues.
  - **9 - 10**: Exceptional; the assistant was extremely helpful with no significant flaws.
- **Note**: Ratings of **1** and **10** should be rare and reserved for exceptionally poor or outstanding performances, respectively.

# Output Format

Provide your response in the following format:

```json
{
  "rating": [float value between 1 and 10],
  "reasoning": "Your reasoning here, referencing key aspects of the final two messages."
}
```

# Notes

- Do not guess; use the provided information only.
- Ensure that your reasoning clearly reflects how the user and agent messages point toward fulfillment (or non-fulfillment) of the provided goal.
- **Do not include any additional fields** beyond the specified output format.

# Additional Considerations

- **Edge Cases Clarification**: Consider scenarios where task completion is ambiguous or partially complete. If there is any doubt, reflect that in your rating and reasoning.
- **Assessment Criteria**: Assess if the user explicitly acknowledged satisfaction or if the agent provided complete and unambiguous information.
- **Confidence in Judgment**: Be conservative in your judgment. If the information provided in the last two messages does not clearly indicate completion, your rating should reflect that.

# Examples

**Goal**: Provide an informative answer about the Eiffel Tower's history.

**Last two messages**:

- **User**: "Can you tell me about the history of the Eiffel Tower?"
